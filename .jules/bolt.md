## 2024-05-22 - Safe Caching of Mutable Objects
**Learning:** `_rubric_difficulty_components` in `train_rlaif.py` returns a mutable dictionary. Simply caching it with `@lru_cache` is dangerous because callers might modify the returned dictionary, polluting the cache for future calls.
**Action:** When caching functions that return mutable objects (dicts, lists), use a two-layer approach: 1) A cached implementation function (`_impl`) that returns the object, and 2) A wrapper function that calls `_impl(...).copy()` to return a safe, independent copy to the caller. This incurs a small copy cost but guarantees correctness.
