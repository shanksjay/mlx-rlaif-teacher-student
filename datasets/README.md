# Code RLAIF Dataset

This dataset contains prompts, teacher-generated code, student-generated code, and scoring parameters from the RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) training process.

## Dataset Description

This dataset was generated during the fine-tuning of a Qwen model for code generation using RLAIF methodology. Each entry includes:

- **Prompt**: The original code generation prompt
- **Language**: Programming language (Python, C++, or Rust)
- **Student Code**: Code generated by the student model (Qwen)
- **Teacher Code**: High-quality reference code generated by the teacher model (OpenAI/Claude)
- **Student Score**: Quality score for student code (0.0-1.0)
- **Teacher Score**: Quality score for teacher code (0.0-1.0)
- **Reward**: Normalized reward (student_score / teacher_score)
- **Scoring Breakdown**: Detailed scoring parameters
- **Timestamp**: When the entry was created

## Dataset Structure

- **Training Set**: 600 examples
- **Validation Set**: 0 examples
- **Evaluation Set**: 0 examples

## Data Fields

Each example contains:
- `prompt` (string): Code generation prompt
- `language` (string): Programming language (python, cpp, rust)
- `student_code` (string): Code generated by student model
- `teacher_code` (string): Reference code from teacher model
- `student_score` (float): Quality score for student code
- `teacher_score` (float): Quality score for teacher code
- `reward` (float): Normalized reward value
- `scoring_breakdown` (dict): Detailed scoring parameters
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp

## Usage

### Load from Hugging Face

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("mlx-community/code-rlaif-dataset")

# Access training data
train_data = dataset['train']
print(train_data[0])
```

### Load from Local Files

```python
import json

# Load training data
with open('datasets/train.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        entry = json.loads(line)
        print(entry['prompt'])
        print(entry['teacher_code'])
        print(f"Score: {entry['student_score']}")
```

## Training Details

- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct
- **Teacher Model**: anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
- **Training Steps**: 0
- **Languages**: Python, C++, Rust
- **Average Reward**: 0.356

## Scoring Methodology

Scores are computed using the teacher model evaluating code on:
- **Correctness** (30%): Does the code solve the problem correctly?
- **Code Quality** (30%): Is it clean, readable, and well-structured?
- **Efficiency** (20%): Is it efficient and follows best practices?
- **Documentation** (20%): Is it well-documented?
